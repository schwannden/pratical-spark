# Deploy Spark

Spark cluster can be managed in 3 ways:

1. [Mesos](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/running-on-mesos.html)
2. [Yarn](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/running-on-yarn.html)
3. [Spark Standalone](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/spark-standalone.html)

And since Spark Standalone comes form Spark directly, I will use this as an example to avoid further installation details.
